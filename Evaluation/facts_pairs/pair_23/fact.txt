Release Date: November 21, 2022
About the Sound: This is an inside-out scan of the light echo rings formed by dust scattering and the background stars.Dust scattering ringsThe sound is generated by a series of tick-like sounds. The volume and density of ticks is controlled by the ring brightness.Listening to the pattern of rings in this way traces the density of dust clouds that the light has scattered off of on its way towards Earth.The sound generated by the Swift X-ray data is represented as lower frequencies.The Chandra X-ray data represents higher frequency light and its corresponding sound is limited to higher frequencies.Background stars (DSS Optical data)Each visible light star triggers a musical note. The volume and pitch of the note are determined by the brightness of the star. Brighter stars are louder and higher pitched.
