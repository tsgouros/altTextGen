In this composite image, a translucent cherry red blob floats in a dark sky packed with gleaming white and golden stars. The blob is the remnant of a supernova, the debris from an exploded white dwarf star. This star exploded several hundred years ago, within Earth's timeframe. It's known as SNR 0519-69.0, or SNR 0519 for short.
Here, the supernova remnant resembles a translucent ball of red jelly tumbling through space. The glossy shape is outlined by thin, more opaque red lines. A few similar red lines stretch across the surface of the supernova remnant, delineating bulges in the shape like the lines between the rounded plates on a turtle's shell.
A wispy ring of grey clouds tinted with green, blue and purple sits inside the supernova remnant. In this composite image, reds and whites represent optical data from the Hubble Space Telescope. Greens, blues and purples represent X-ray data from the Chandra Observatory.
