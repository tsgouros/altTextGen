This release features a composite image of a supernova remnant, which resembles a ball of swirling, red, purple and blue clouds veined with bright white light. 
Inside this supernova remnant, near our lower left, is a white dot; a fast-moving pulsar. This pulsar, J1124-5916, is enlarged in an inset found at the lower left hand corner of the main image. In the enlarged inset, a near-horizontal oblong aura surrounding the dot becomes clear. 
A pair of supplementary images are also included in today's release. In those images, labeled 2006 and 2016, small red plus symbols sit inside blue pixelated ovals. The red symbols represent the position of the pulsar inside the supernova remnant in 2006. In the first image, labeled 2006, the red symbol is near the center of the blue pixelated oval. In the second, labeled 2016, the blue oval has shifted down and to the left. This shows the shift in position of the pulsar between 2006 and 2016. Though this shift appears small in these renderings, calculations made by combining Chandra's high-resolution images with the coordinates of the pulsar, and other X-ray sources from the Gaia satellite, indicate that the pulsar has moved 120 billion miles in a 10-year span.
