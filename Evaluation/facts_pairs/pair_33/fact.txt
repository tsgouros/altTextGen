About the Sound: This is more than a data sonification, it's actually a re-sonification of a real sound waveResearchers identified literal sound waves in earlier images of this cluster (the lowest pitches ever found), we have extracted them and made them audible for the first timeWaves propagating along each radial direction  (and any periodic features) are extracted from the image, sweeping around 360 degreesSignals are resynthesized after scaling by 57 and 58 octaves above their true pitch, 144 and 288 quadrillion (million billion) times their true frequency, or about 7 piano-lengthsThe true pitch of the sound waves generated by the black hole is Bb, just over 57 octaves below middle CWaves were extracted from blue imagehereandherePurple image used for visualization (radar plus audio spectra)Sound contains the actual waves plus some signals from other large scale density fluctuations (such as cavities)
Scale: Image is about 8 arcmin (550,000 light years) across
