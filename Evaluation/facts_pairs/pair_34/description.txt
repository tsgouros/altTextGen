This release features four images of star-packed galaxies, each overlaid with a small white box at the center. Inside the boxes are burgeoning black holes, which resemble glowing dots ringed with hot pink light.
The images of the four galaxies, N G C 1385, 1566, 3344, and 6503 have much in common. They are all composite images containing X-ray data from Chandra, and optical images from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. All four feature scores of tiny glowing specks, and clouds of gas and dust in faint blues and purples. And all four galaxies have a swirling, spiraling quality.
In appearance, N G C 3344 is a typical spiral galaxy, presented face on. Several wispy arms of tiny blue and larger red specks swirl around a soft patch of glowing light at its core. N G C 1566 is also presented face on, and features similar spiraling arms. But in this galaxy there are fewer arms, the glowing patch is more diffuse, and the specks of light have a dusty rose hue. N G C 1385 is a more solid cloud of blue and purple gas and dust. Hints of a spiraling movement are present in thin breaks in the cloud, which resemble fine veins in marble. Similar patterns can be found in N G C 6503. This galaxy is presented at a sharp angle, like a dinner plate leaning against a wall, viewed from the side.
At the center of each galaxy, a thin white box has been added to the image. Inside each is a glowing white dot with a hot pink aura: burgeoning black holes. Magnification reveals some of these black holes to be brighter and more clearly defined. Others appear muted, but are still readily discernible.
