This release features a composite image of an indigo beam of matter and anti-matter cutting through red clouds of gas, as well as a close-up of the pulsar from which it originates.
In the primary image, the long indigo beam begins at our upper left and exits the image at our lower right. This is approximately one third of the beam's actual length. The beam appears thin and consists of many distinct dots, like a string of indigo beads. It travels through brick orange clouds of gas past many specks of orange, red, white, and purple light.
At the upper left is the source of the beam, the pulsar known as J2030. J2030 is a dense, city-sized object that formed from the collapse of a massive star. In the primary image, it resembles a stout, white, vertical line with a purple aura. In the close-up, the spinning pulsar resembles a snowman made with glowing indigo rings. The bottom ring is largest and darkest. The middle ring is slightly smaller and lighter in color. The top section is a solid white oval with an indigo blue aura. 
Two faint, translucent, red shapes surround the pulsar. A bulbous sphere encloses the bottom half, and a conical shape surrounds the middle section like a wraparound cape. These are "bough" (spelled b o w) shocks of gas which often move in front of fast-moving pulsars, like water piling up at the "bough" (spelled b o w) of a moving boat.
