The primary graphic of today's release is an optical image of a galaxy group inset with an X-ray close-up of a dwarf galaxy, all backed by black space dotted with specks of light. The center of the galaxy group HCG068 appears on our left side of this horizontal graphic near several bright stars. The most prominent members are four distinct, labeled galaxies. NGC 5355 is a glowing silver speck. 5350 is a silver galaxy with spiralling radial arms. And 5353 and 5354 are two galaxies in a golden haze, which together resemble an apostrophe or comma.
At our lower right is a glowing white dot labeled Mrk 462. This is the dwarf galaxy. Above it is an X-ray enlargement, presented in an outlined square. Here, Mrk 462 resembles a large, hazy neon pink circle. The X-rays emitted by this relatively small galaxy reveal the presence of a supermassive black hole about 200,000 times the mass of our Sun.
