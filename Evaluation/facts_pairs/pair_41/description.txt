This release features two images of the same galaxy cluster, RBS 797, presented side-by-side. The first, on our left, is an optical image from NASAï¿½s Hubble Space Telescope. The second, on our right, is an X-ray image from the Chandra X-ray Observatory.
The optical image on our left features short streaks of golden light and golden stars of varying sizes set against a black background. While many of the stars resemble small roundish specks, others feature shafts of light bursting from brilliant, round cores. At the center of the image is a small fuzzy oval, surrounded by a glowing ring and a patch of golden haze. This is the large galaxy in the center of RBS 797.
The X-ray image on our right does not show the clustered galaxies, rather the hot gas that envelopes them. The image is royal blue in color, and somewhat mottled or cloudy. At the center is a pair of irregular black ovals, ringed with white and pale blue. These side-by-side shapes are X-ray cavities, thought to be a byproduct of eruptions from a giant black hole at the center of the cluster.
Additional cavities are found above and below the pair, though these black shapes are harder to distinguish and do not feature outer rings. These four cavities are arranged like the leaves on a four-leaf clover, with the leaves on our right and left far more distinct than the leaves at the top and bottom.
