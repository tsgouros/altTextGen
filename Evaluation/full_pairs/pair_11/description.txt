This composite visualization combines X-ray, radio and optical images of hot gas, jets of particles, and a galaxy with an unseen black hole. Improbably, the resulting visual resembles a neon pink uppercase 'H' with a white splotch on the crossbar, leaning back against a vertical, neon blue pillow, floating in the blackness of space. 
The white splotch on the cross bar is the galaxy Messier 84. The neon pink found in the uppercase H shape represents multimillion degree gas. The neon blue in the pillow behind it represents jets of particles produced by the unseen black hole at the center of the galaxy.
Here, two neon blue jets blast away from the bright white galaxy, M84. One aims up, the other aims down. The ends of the blue jets have created the look of a vertical, lumpy blue pillow. These powerful jets have pushed out the clouds of hot gas that surround the black hole in the center of M84. The holes they created leave the pink gas resembling an uppercase 'H'.  The crossbar is what remains at the center of the neon pink cloud, surrounding the brilliant white galaxy at its core.
Specks of gas rendered in neon pink dot the black background, like spatter from an artistâ€™s brush. Around the outside of the image, other galaxies are seen in white.
