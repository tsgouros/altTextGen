This release features four distinct images, presented in a two-by-two grid. At our upper left is an image created with X-ray data from a galaxy located about 4 billion light years from Earth. At the upper right is an optical image of the same galaxy. At our lower left is an image featuring X-ray data from a galaxy located about 1.5 billion light years from Earth. At our lower right is an optical image from that galaxy.
The images highlighting Chandra's X-ray data, on our left, feature white dots ringed with hot pink, set against a black background. Each of these dots shows X-rays from matter around a supermassive black hole. The more distant galaxy features two small dots with bright white cores; one at the center of the image, and one toward our upper right. Several smaller, faint pink dots without white cores are also present in the X-ray image.
The image created using X-ray data from the less distant galaxy, at our lower left, features one large, hazy dot. This dot also shows X-rays from matter around a supermassive black hole. It has a large white core and a wide pink ring. 
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey optical images on our right feature colorful specks of red, green, yellow, and blue, set against a black background. These are a mixture of stars and galaxies. Visually, they range from tiny flecks of dim light, to large gleaming circles ringed with translucent halos. The optical image of the more distant galaxy, at our upper right, appears sharper and more in focus than the image of the other galaxy at our lower right.
The optical images of both galaxies do not show radiation from material around the supermassive black holes featured in the X-ray images on the left.
