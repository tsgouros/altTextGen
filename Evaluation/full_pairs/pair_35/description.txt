This release features a composite image of specks of light in the blackness of space, as well as a separate enlarged inset. This is a protocluster, a collection of galaxies and gas that will eventually evolve into a galaxy cluster.
The specks of light are evenly distributed across the main image. Some are tiny pinpricks, while others register as large dots with glowing auras. These specks and dots, galaxies and black holes, glow in a variety of colors. Red, green, and white specks appear courtesy of the Subaru optical telescope in Hawaii. Purple specks were captured by NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory.
In the center of the image is a mid-sized, light purple dot surrounded by a hazy purple cloud. This is the center of the protocluster enlarged in the accompanying inset. In the enlargement, it becomes evident that the primary purple dot is accompanied by a slightly smaller purple dot, above and to our right. At the center of the smaller purple dot is a golden light resembling a fine wire filament in a lightbulb. 
The larger purple dot is covered by a streak of faint purple cloud. Inside the cloud are similar golden lights, connected by a stringy, golden gauze. The golden lights are small galaxies around a larger galaxy in the center. The gold lights and gauze resemble a cosmic cobweb, earning it the nickname The Spiderweb Galaxy.
