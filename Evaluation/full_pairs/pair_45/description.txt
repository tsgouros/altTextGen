The primary visual in this release is a composite image of a hazy blue marble-like sphere, floating in a black field dotted with yellow specks. This is the supernova remnant G344, the remains of a type 1a supernova. These supernovas can result from white dwarf stars accumulating material from a companion star until the white dwarf explodes. In this composite image, and in the accompanying single layer images, each color represents data captured by a different telescope. 
The hazy blue color of the marble-like sphere represents X-rays from the Chandra telescope. Inside the blue sphere are faint green squiggles and patches of hot pink. The green squiggles and a faint, wispy green cloud to the right of the blue sphere, at the edge of the composite image, represent infrared data collected by the Spitzer Space Telescope. The yellow specks, and cloudy yellow layer hidden under the blue haze also represent data collected by Spitzer. The hot pink patches represent data collected by two radio telescopes: the NSF's Very Large Array, and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization's Australia Telescope Compact Array.
