This composite image features the ringed planet Uranus set against the blackness of space. The planet is depicted in blues and pinks, encircled by a near vertical white ring. The blue and white colors represent infrared data obtained by the Keck-1 Telescope, and the pink represents X-ray data gathered by NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory. The blues, which appear as blended, near vertical stripes, range from midnight blue at our right, to teal and even neon sky blue at our left. Across the right half of the planet is a teardrop-shaped patch of neon pink which is more solid near the bottom and somewhat less defined near the top. Several pale blue dots mark the surface of the planet, though none appear in the hot pink patch. The near vertical ring, which is slightly tipped toward our upper-right, is quite thin. It appears white when set against the black background, and pink when it passes in front of the planet's pink patch. Upon closer inspection, other faint, concentric rings can be spotted inside this bright ring, primarily at the furthest reaches when set against the blackness of space.
