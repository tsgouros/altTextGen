Supernova 1987A
This image of Supernova 1987a uses an inset picture to reveal the magnification of an object located deep inside another, larger, object. The larger object is a ring of gas and dust identified by NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory. With mottled colors ranging from dark red to white-orange, it resembles a ring of fire or hot coals.
Data collected by Chandra as well as the NuSTAR mission suggests that a pulsar wind nebula swirling around a neutron star is at the center of the mottled ring. In the magnified inset, a close up of the center of the supernova, is an illustration of the nebula. This swirling purple nebula resembles an oil-slick floating on dark water. At the nebula’s core is a brilliant white sphere: the neutron star. The magnetic field of this exceedingly dense object is represented by a series of thin purple hoops. These hoops loop through the poles of the neutron star. The poles are marked by a representation of the pulsar’s light: an extended teal-blue midline which cuts through the neutron star along its polar axis.
