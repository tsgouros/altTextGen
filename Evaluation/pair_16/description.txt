This release features a composite image of the Tycho supernova remnant, a spherical neon pink cloud set against a starry sky. The cloud is ejected material still propagating from a star that exploded in 1572, as seen from Earth.
Here, the supernova resembles a fluffy pink cotton ball. The dense, translucent cloud is streaked with hazy red veins, and mottled with purple and blue. The edges of the cloud appear to be highlighted in soft white. The reds and blues in the supernova represent high resolution X-ray data from the Chandra X-ray observatory. The dark purples and whites represent data from IXPE: the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer.
Upon close inspection, a thin red line can be discerned around the outer edge of the neon pink cloud. The red line shows where electrons have been accelerated to high energies, producing X-rays detected by Chandra. This provides evidence that supernova remnants are a major source of energetic particles, including electrons and protons, which continually hit Earth's atmosphere.
