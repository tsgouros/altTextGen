This release features a 10 second video of a 3D model, optimized for virtual reality. This is a 3D model of a supernova remnant called IC 443, located about 5,000 light years from Earth. In the video, the translucent remnants of the stellar explosion appear static as we travel through them. 
First we enter a mottled dark blue sphere, which resembles a thin layer of sparse clouds. This is the outer blast wave of the IC 443 supernova explosion. Once inside this largely transparent, slightly irregular sphere, we travel through a tangled mass of smoky tendrils, depicted in pumpkin orange and mustard yellow. These clouds represent the outer layers of the exploded star.  We pause beside a gnarled, translucent ring which stands vertically to our left. This purple donut shape represents the supernova shockwave. Patches of red appear to sit on the surface of the shockwave, and float beyond it [inside the outer blast wave]. These patches show remains from the exploded star.
Before the video ends, our focus shifts, and we begin to zoom in on a small, bright sky blue cloud with a white core. This represents the nebula of particles and energy around a neutron star found in Chandraâ€™s data.
