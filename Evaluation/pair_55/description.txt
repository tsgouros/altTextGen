The primary image of this release depicts a variety of chemical elements blasting out from the center of a supernova remnant known as Cassiopeia A -- or Cas A -- 11,000 light years from Earth. This visual representation resembles a patchwork cloud in mottled neon orange, purple, green, blue, and yellow, set against a starry sky. The orange represents iron, which appears in patches to our left, right, and near the top of the image. The purple represents oxygen, and can be found in wispy tendrils to the left of center. The lime green color represents the amount of silicon compared to magnesium. It can be found throughout the cloud shape, and appears to drift off at our upper left. The bright steel blue color is clustered near the center of the cloud. This represents the titanium previously detected by NASA's NuSTAR telescope. Now, Chandra's X-ray Observatory has discovered a different type of titanium blasting from the center of Cas A. This new titanium is too faint to be shown in the image data.  The X-rays are overlaid on an optical-light image from the Hubble Space Telescope. Instead of resembling a distinct patch of cloud, the optical data is more reminiscent of gossamer webbing. The webbing can be found atop the cloud patch near the top of the image, and in a finger-like tangle near the lower right. 
In this representation, the bright steel blue color appears blurred and hazy. In contrast, the mottled greens and oranges appear pixelated upon closer inspection.
