SgrA East
This composite image, depicting a supernova remnant near the center of the Milky Way, resembles spattered, luminous, blue and red paint on a black canvas. The luminous blue spatter represents data collected from Chandra; stellar debris in the X-ray spectrum. The luminous red spatter represents radio emissions from the NSFâ€™s Very Large Array. The outer edges of the image are sparsely dotted with specks, but there is a greater concentration just to the right of center.
When thousands upon thousands of faint specks appear close together, the resulting form resembles a misty cloud. Here, two such clouds are present; one blue and one red. They overlap on the right side of the image.
Two areas of interest are highlighted in an annotated close up of the composite image. In the blue cloud the ellipse is the supernova remnant Sagittarius A East. It includes X-ray emission from elements in the X-ray spectrum, such as iron and nickel. The amounts of these elements mean that Sagittarius A East is a strong candidate for the remains of a rare type of explosion; a Type 1ax supernova.  To the right of the ellipse, where the clouds overlap, a white cross marks a spot inside a bright swirl. The white cross is at the position of Sagittarius A, the supermassive black hole in the center of the Milky Way.
