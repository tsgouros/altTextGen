About the Sound: Radar-like scan, clockwise starting at 12 O’ClockOptical image:brightness controls volume, distance from the center controls musical pitch
(higher notes at larger radii)Can hear arching arms towards top, bottom and either sideDeep thuds heard towards the 4 corners are diffraction spikes from HubbleX-ray image:Brightness controls volume, distance from the center controls pitch (higher tones
at larger radii)
(higher notes at larger radii)X-ray jets are heard most clearly at 2 O’Clock and 8 O’ClockOptical spectrum (included with optical layer):Frequencies of light in optical spectrum are shifted down by 40 octaves to bring
them into the human hearing range when played as soundOptical (HST) is played on a breathy synth (sustained for diffuse gas, plucked for point-like star clusters)X-ray (Chandra) is played on string-like synthThe most intense parts of the core and jet that appear white are also heard as pitch-filtered noiseListening notes:the core near the BH is the brightest/loudestrising jet with gaps and clumps can be heard as rising pitch with volume fluctuationsGlow in HST due to billions of unresolved stars produces sustained chord
Scale: The X-ray image iImage is about 4.2 arcmin (0.86 light years) across
